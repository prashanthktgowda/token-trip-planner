## ‚ú® Overview

Planning group trips often involves scattered information ‚Äì routes in one app, budgets in spreadsheets, and expenses tracked via chat messages. This project aims to consolidate these core aspects into a single platform.

Users can create a "Trip Session," invite participants, plan routes visually using OpenStreetMap, set a collective budget (visualized as "Tokens"), track expenses contributed by different members, and see automatically calculated balances. To manage resources, trip data is automatically cleared 7 days after its creation or conclusion (configurable).

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Interactive Route Planning:** Visualize your journey on OpenStreetMap using Leaflet. Add start/end points, waypoints, and points of interest. Integrates with routing engines (like OSRM or others) to display calculated routes, distances, and estimated times.
*   **üí∞ Budget Management (Token System):** Set a total trip budget in your local currency (e.g., INR). The platform visualizes this budget as "Tokens" (1 Token = 1 Unit of Currency) for easy tracking.
*   **üë• Shared Expense Tracking:** Log expenses as they happen, noting who paid and which participants the expense covers.
*   **üìä Automatic Expense Splitting & Balances:** Expenses are automatically split among designated participants. The platform maintains a running balance for each user within the trip, showing who owes whom.
*   **üîë Multiple Admin Roles:** Assign "Admin" roles within a trip session, granting permissions to manage the budget, edit/delete sensitive expense data, and potentially manage settlements.
*   **üìÑ Downloadable Reports:** Generate and download expense summaries and balance sheets in common formats (e.g., CSV, potentially PDF) for record-keeping.
*   **‚è≥ Temporary Data Storage:** Each trip session's data (routes, expenses, participants) is stored temporarily and automatically removed after a set period (e.g., 7 days) to ensure privacy and manage storage.
*   **üîí User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login managed via Firebase Authentication.
*   **üí® Single Page Application (SPA):** Fluid and responsive user experience built with React.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (UI Library)
*   **Mapping:** [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) with [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) (Interactive Maps)
*   **Routing Engine (Integration):** Designed to work with APIs like [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/), Mapbox Directions, etc. (Route Calculation - *Specific service choice depends on deployment*)
*   **Backend & Database:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Backend-as-a-Service)
    *   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
    *   **Database:** Firestore (NoSQL Database)
    *   **Backend Logic/Cleanup:** Cloud Functions (for TTL/data expiry)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Utility-First CSS Framework)
*   **Report Generation (Client-Side):** Libraries like [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) / [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/)

## üí° Core Concepts Explained

*   **Token System:** A user-friendly label for the budget amount. If the budget is 5000 INR, the trip has 5000 "Tokens". Spending 100 INR reduces the available tokens by 100.
*   **Temporary Storage:** Trip data is associated with a specific `tripId`. Using Firebase Cloud Functions triggered by Cloud Scheduler, we can query for trips older than 7 days (based on `creationTimestamp` or `endTimestamp`) and delete the corresponding Firestore documents and sub-collections.
*   **Admin Roles:** Within a specific trip document in Firestore, participant data includes a `role` field (`'admin'` or `'participant'`). Frontend UI and Firestore Security Rules enforce permissions based on this role.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A Firebase project set up. You will need your Firebase project configuration keys.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/collaborative-trip-planner.git
    cd collaborative-trip-planner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Firestore Database, Firebase Authentication (e.g., Email/Password), and Cloud Functions.
    *   Get your Firebase project configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) from your Firebase project settings.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example` if provided).
    *   Add your Firebase configuration keys to the `.env` file:
        ```plaintext
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        # Add any other required environment variables (e.g., routing API keys)
        ```

4.  **Deploy Firebase Rules & Functions:**
    *   Set up the Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools` or `yarn global add firebase-tools`).
    *   Log in (`firebase login`).
    *   Configure Firestore security rules (found in `firestore.rules`). Deploy using `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`.
    *   Deploy the Cloud Functions (found in the `functions` directory) needed for data cleanup (`firebase deploy --only functions`). *Ensure the functions are correctly written to handle data deletion based on timestamps.*

### Running the Project

*   Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
*   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is well-suited for deployment using:

*   **Frontend:** Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel.
*   **Backend:** Firebase services are already cloud-based. Ensure Cloud Functions for cleanup are deployed and scheduled correctly.
